-Every React element in a list should have a key assigned to it. The key is an HTML attribute and should be a stable identifier. 
-When using keys, React can efficiently exchange the changed items. When not using keys, React may update the list inefficiently.

Ex.) 
    <ul>
      {list.map(function (item) {
        return ( <li key={item.objectID}> {item.title} </li>;
      })}
    </ul>

-As a last resort you can use the index of the item in the list too. It should be avoided because it comes with the same rendering performance issues as
not using a key.

ex.)
  <ul>
      {list.map(function (item, index) {
        return (
        <li key={index}> 
          {item.title} 
        </li>;
      })}
    </ul>
