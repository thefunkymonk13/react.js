Form data is always handled by a react component in a controlled component. The input's value is driven by the React State.

The HTML should know about the React state so we need to provide the current state as a value to it:

const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('React');


<Search search={searchTerm} onSearch={handleSearch} />


const Search = (props) => (
  <div>
    <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
    <input id="search" type="text" value={props.search} onChange={props.onSearch} />
  </div>
);
