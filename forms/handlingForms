Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.

In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.

In React, form data is usually handled by the components.

When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.

You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute.

We can use the useState Hook to keep track of each inputs value and provide a "single source of truth" for the entire application.

example:

import { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  return (
    <form>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input
          type="text" 
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
    </form>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<MyForm />);
