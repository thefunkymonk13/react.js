-React State introduces a mutable data structure. These stateful values get instantiated in a React component as so called state, can be passed with props
as a vehicle down to child components, and can also get mutated by using a function to modify the state.

-State is used to change information over time

Following use case:

The user types text into an html input field and wants to see the information (state) displayed next to it.

const Search = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
  setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
  <div>
      <label htmlFor='search'>Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
    <p>
      Searching for <strong>{searchTerm}</strong>
    </p>
    

    </div>
  );
  };
