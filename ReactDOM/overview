-React DOM is usually used once in a React application to hook React into the native HTML world. Open the public/index.html file on the side and spot the
HTML element where the id attribute equals "root". That's exactly the element where React inserts itself into the HTML to bootstrap the entire
React application - starting with the App component.

-React DOM is everything that's needed to integrate React into any website which uses HTML. There is usually only one ReactDOM.createRoot() call in your
application. If you happen to work on a legacy application that used something other than React before, you may see multiple ReactDOM() calls, because
only certain areas of the application are powered by React.
